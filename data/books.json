Published by Steidl and Le Bal, the publication brings together all 12 of Kitajima’s published works as fascisimile.

Although Martens is widely recognised for his specialisation in typography, the dozens of full-page patterns shown here are devoid of any text, allowing the sequence to become a mesmerising pattern in itself. Designed by Martens & Martens."
